                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>- Social Benefits  -</b></h2>
                     <p>There are many reasons to join Polyfest, for example there are many social benefits like meeting new people, making new friends and also Polyfest helps people step out of their comfort zone to perform in front of hundreds of people. Polyfest also helps connect other schools in the form of traditional dances and songs, with many schools that may not have many performers combine with each other as one group.
                    </P>
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Cultural Appreciation -</h2>
                    <p>Another big reason to join is culture appreciation, representing your unique and special culture through dance and song, and also learning more about your culture and other cultures, and even if you arenâ€™t Polynesian or Maori you can still learn more about different cultures.
