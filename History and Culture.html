                <h1> History & Culture</h1>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Past  -</h2>
                     <p>Polyfest has a deep history dating back to 1976 with only four eager schools between Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate, Aorere College, Seddon College which is now called Western Springs College and Mangere College, with all schools ready to show off their culture.</P>
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Present -</h2>
                    <p>Now to the present Polyfest has been a thriving cultural celebration with this year, 2024, being the 48th proud anniversary and here in Porirua we have eight different culture, Tongan, Samoan, Cook island, Tokelau, Fijian, Kiribati, Maori, Niue with unique songs and dances, because of the deep and important history, Polyfest has become the special celebration it is today.<br></p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Future -</h2>
                    <p>I think that the future of Polyfest is looking real bright because I think that there would be much more cultures to showcase and of course there will be many more schools participating. The history of Polyfest is really important because it affects the future years to come in terms of the songs and dances they perform and just Polyfest overall, that's why we should always treasure the past so that we may look into the future.</p>  
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Culture -</h2>
                    <p>Polyfest celebrates different cultures like Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga and many other pacific cultures. Every culture is important in Polyfest, no matter who performs it because all the unique dances and songs from different places has been made or written by the creator with respect and pride of their piece and performing the item with respect no matter if youâ€™re from the same island as the piece would be huge respect to the creator.                    </p>
