                     <p>Aotea College Polyfest for me was a very exciting experience, I met many people and I also learnt alot more about my culture, Samoa. I made many new friends from my school and other schools and Polyfest helped me to learn more about my culture.
                        At first I joined Polyfest because I was told to join by my parents, I felt a little bit nervous but I was glad I already knew some people that joined with me. But as time went on and more pratices we did I didn't feel nervous at all and I learnt so much more about my culture and now I joining this years Polyfest more excited than ever.
