            <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Page</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Polyfest is a multicultural event said to be the most popular college cultural dance festival, with many schools around New Zealand embracing the wonderful event, including my school, Aotea College. Polyfest also has a deep and meaningful history with many different cultures involved, and if nervous or clueless on why to join there are many benefits for you to join all in this one website.</p>
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why I Made This Website</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">This website was made for a coding assignment, where we had to make a website about a certain topic and my topic is of course, Polyfest, where it took me quite a while to make this website, but I am sure thanks to you for looking at it.</p>
